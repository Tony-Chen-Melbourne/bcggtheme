# bcggtheme
A ggplot2 theme to create graphs in the style of BCG

The package needs to be downloaded and installed from Github. The easiest way to do this is with the devtools package. If you donâ€™t have the devtools package, install it:

`install.packages("devtools")`

Once devtools is installed, you can download and install the theme as follows:

`devtools::install_github("Tony-Chen-Melbourne/bcggtheme")`

The vignettes file explains how the package works.

The package draws heavily on [grattantheme](https://github.com/grattan/grattantheme) created by Matt Cowgill, and maintained by Matt Cowgill and Will Mackey.
